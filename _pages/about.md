Hi! I am Ankit, a former Research Fellow at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS), where I engaged in exciting research in the field of extragalactic astrophysics since November 2020.

During my PhD research, I delved into the intricacies of galaxy properties and their evolution within large-scale environments. Leveraging analytical models and multi-wavelength observations from telescopes such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and GALEX, as well as insights from hydrodynamical simulations like the EAGLE cosmological simulations, I sought to unravel the underlying physical processes shaping galaxies.

I have led and collaborated on several projects in my postdoctoral endeavours, employing cutting-edge tools such as the Horizon Run 5 (HR5) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. From investigating the influence of local environments on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to exploring the distribution of dark matter halos using Intracluster Light (ICL), my research spans a wide spectrum of galactic phenomena. Additionally, I have ventured into generating mock Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of galaxies in HR5 using Monte-Carlo dust radiative transfer post-processing. This enables a deeper exploration of galaxies in infrared wavelengths. Furthermore, using insights from the EAGLE simulation, I enhanced and applied analytical models from my PhD to study the effects of orbital parameters on ram pressure stripping (RPS).

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have actively contributed to educational initiatives, mentoring students and conducting skywatch events for the general public. When I am not busy exploring galaxies on the computer, I like to explore nature around me. I love to cycle, play guitar, listen to music, and talk.
