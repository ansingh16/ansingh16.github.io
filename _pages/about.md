Hi! I am Ankit, currently a Research Fellow at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS), where I have been engaged in exciting research in the field of extragalactic astrophysics since November 2020.

During my PhD research, I delved into the intricacies of galaxy properties and their evolution within large-scale environments. Leveraging analytical models and multi-wavelength observations from telescopes such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and GALEX, as well as insights from hydrodynamical simulations like the EAGLE cosmological simulations, I sought to unravel the underlying physical processes shaping galaxies.

In my postdoctoral endeavors, I have led and collaborated on several projects, employing cutting-edge tools such as the Horizon Run 5 (HR5) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. From investigating the influence of local environments on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to exploring the distribution of dark matter halos using Intracluster Light (ICL), my research spans a wide spectrum of galactic phenomena. Additionally, I have ventured into generating mock Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of galaxies in HR5 using Monte-Carlo dust radiative transfer post processing. This enables a deeper exploration of galaxies in infrared wavelengths. Furthermore, I enhanced and applied analytical models from my PhD to study the effects of orbital parameters on ram pressure stripping (RPS) using insights from the EAGLE simulation.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have actively contributed to educational initiatives, mentoring students and conducting skywatch events for the general public. When I am not busy exploring galaxies in computer I like to explore nature around me. I love to do cycling, play guitar, listening to music and treking.
